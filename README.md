# Learning C++ Programming 

Although there are numerous programming languages available in the market to work upon,but C++ has never lost its charm since its inception and still has a strong impact in the development world. As per the reports, C++ comes under a few top programming languages across the world. Alike the C programming language, C++ also makes it easier for you to understand the underlying architecture of programming, although it also supports other additional features such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, etc. Moreover, various IT giants Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. offer numerous career opportunities to C++ professionals, hence you’re strongly recommended to give it a try and start to learn C++ Programming. 




## WEEK 1 : Introduction to C++  
### Topics to Learn

### Project:
##### 1. simple calulator
##### 2.group discussion



## WEEK 2 :   Conditional & Control Statements
Okay, now move to the control flow statements of the C++ programming language. Precisely, control flow statements concerned with the concepts like repeated execution of a block of statements – Loops, execution of code based on decision – Decision-Making Statements, etc. You need to cover these concepts thoroughly such as all types of loops like For Loop, While Loop, Do While loop, etc. and similarly all decision-making statements like if, if..else, nested if, etc. There are several other topics as well that concern with the control flow statements in C++ programming such as Jump Statements, Switch Statements, etc.
